The bike accessories product category comprised 45% of orders, indicating that customers prefer us for our many bike customization options and repairs.
The clothing product category made up a significantly smallar proportion of orders at 18.5%. This data combined with helmets having a return rate of over 3%, which was 33% higher than the average return rate for all items indicates that the clothing product category is an area that needs attention.
Despite this, monthly returns are down from previous month. Monthly revenue is higher while orders are lower due to more high ticket items being sold than the previous month.
